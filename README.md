# Matrix-Inversion-Method for 3x3 Matrix
1. I have calculated the determinant initially
2. I have transposed the matrix A
3. I have found the cofactor matrix of the transpose matrix
4. After that, the cofactor matrix was multiplied with the X matrix
5. Finally dividing the result matrix by the initially calculated determinant, the B matrix was calculated.
